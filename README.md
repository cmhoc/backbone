Initially as a test for discordgo, this test has grown into the main backbone for
cmhocs automation process and controls the majority if not the entirety. Because all streams of the automation are
connected, much of it can be accessed and adjusted through the discord bot or the website.
For detailed documentation please view the readme's in each directory.
