        All of the data presented on this site is done so by loading the data from SQL into the Golang program running
        this server and then uploading the data to different pages in the form of JSON. This JSON is then used by JavaScript
        and runs the various parts of this site. In doing so it is also possible to make personal applications using the same
        data. I have provided API supported for a few programming languages that I will maintain, and these will allow you to
        easily play with the data. Other languages main gain support later, or they may never. The best way to find out
        is to ask me directly. I have also provided here links to each page that presents JSON data so you may create your
        own API wrapper should you so choose. Take note however, that I will not continue to support and host old API versions
        should it change.
